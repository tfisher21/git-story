Today has been a good day. However, it was tough to wake up so early on a Sunday. Classes have been fun, and I'm learning so much. We learned about some extremely basic coding set-up for macOS. We have also twice gone around the room and talked about ourselves. Peter also taught us about a "stand-up meeting" (where everyone stands for the meeting to keep it short).
